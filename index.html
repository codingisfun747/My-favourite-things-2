    <h2> I love to do art </h2>
    <p id="text"> Ever since I was little I have loved to do art. I find it a expressive form to express how you feel, I draw in different styles all the time recently I have been learning digital art. Digotal art is a way to use techonolgy and minipulate images in different ways as well as just drawing. I do alot of watercolour art and arclic, mix media art too. I recommened art to many people becuase I find it helps reliese your stress. </p></section>
